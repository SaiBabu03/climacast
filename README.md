# climacast

A Flutter project to show the weather condition with OpenWeatherMap API's.

## Getting Started
In the First Screen we have a search bar to search the location .

Once we entered the location in the search bar and tap on the search button.
It redirects to the weather data showing Temperature, Location, weather condition,
humidity and wind.

To refresh the data we have a Refresh icon in Bottom Navigation Bar.

In this app we also get the weather of the user's current location by tapping on the 
location arrow icon in the bottom navigation bar.

If we want to search another location tap on the search icon in the bottom navigation bar.
